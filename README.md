# synthetic SNN model for sparsity analysis
<h3> Description: </h3>
 An arbitary Convolutional layer with OC:128, IC:128, K:3, pad:1, and stride:1 dimensions followed by a LIF layer<br>
 The layersweep.csv contains a timeloop-friendly workload descriptions of different weight and activation sparsity. Each layer runs for 20 timesteps.<br>
